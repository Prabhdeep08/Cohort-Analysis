# Cohort-Analysis
Cohort Analysis using Python to study user retention and behavior trends over time with clear visualizations and business insights.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **cohort analysis** performed using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**.  
The goal of the analysis is to understand **user behavior and retention patterns over time** by grouping users into cohorts based on their first activity.

Cohort analysis is widely used in product analytics, marketing analytics, and customer retention studies to identify trends, churn, and long-term engagement.

## Problem Statement
Analyze the transaction data of a bicycle manufaacturing company to:
- Group users into cohorts based on their **transaction date**
- Track user retention across subsequent time periods
- Identify trends in user engagement over time

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
- **datetime** - date time based cohort
- **missingno** - inspecting missing values

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains user-level transaction/activity data, including:
- customer ID
- Activity / transaction date
- Additional attributes used for analysis


---

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Identifying the **cohort month** for each user  
3. Calculating the **cohort index**  
4. Creating cohort tables using pivot tables  
5. Visualizing retention patterns using heatmaps and charts  

---

## Key Insights
- Identified how user retention changes over time across different cohorts
- Highlighted cohorts with stronger long-term engagement
- Observed patterns useful for business decision-making
